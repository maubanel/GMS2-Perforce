##### `Step 1.`\|`GMP`|:small_blue_diamond:

Now you need to move the **GameMaker** project folder you were working on into the **Perforce** workspace that you have just created with the single **Readme** file.  I called my project `GettingStarted`. Move the entire folder into this workspace as you will have all of your gamemaker games in this folder.

##### `Step 2.`\|`GMP`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Log back into **P4V** and enter your workspace (or create a new one if you are on a new computer).  Make sure you are on the **Workspace** tab. Press the <kbd>Refresh</kbd> button and make sure you now see your folder containing your **GameMaker** project.

Make sure you are in the **Workspace** tab.  Select the uppermost folder (your LSU username) and press the <kbd>Add</kbd> button.  Select `New` and type in a message describing the work done.  Press the <kbd>OK</kbd> button.

Go to the **Pending** tab (if you don't see it you can select **View | Pending**) to add it to the window.  You should now see the commit message you made. Your pending number will be different.
